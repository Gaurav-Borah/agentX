AI Agents: Detailed Notes
1. Introduction to AI Agents
An AI Agent is an autonomous or semi-autonomous system that perceives its environment, reasons, and takes actions to achieve specific goals.
Definition:
 An AI agent is any entity that can observe (perceive information), decide (plan or reason), and act (execute actions) in a given environment to maximize the probability of achieving its goals.


Key Characteristics:


Autonomy: Operates without constant human supervision.


Reactivity: Responds to changes in the environment.


Proactiveness: Takes initiative to fulfill goals.


Social Ability: Can interact with humans or other agents if needed.


Example:


ChatGPT with tools (e.g., browsing, code execution) can be considered a conversational AI agent.


A self-driving car is an autonomous AI agent.



2. Core Components of an AI Agent
An AI agent typically consists of the following components:
Component
Function
Perception
Collects data from the environment (sensors, APIs, user input).
Knowledge Base / Memory
Stores information, past experiences, or world models.
Reasoning / Decision Making
Chooses actions using algorithms, logic, or machine learning.
Action / Actuator
Executes the chosen actions in the environment (outputs, API calls, movements).
Learning
Improves over time using feedback (reinforcement learning, fine-tuning, RAG).

Simplified Architecture:
Environment <--> Sensors -> Perception -> Reasoning -> Action -> Actuators -> Environment


3. Types of AI Agents
AI Agents can be classified based on capabilities, architecture, or level of intelligence.
3.1 Based on Capability
Simple Reflex Agents


Action is rule-based: “If condition, then action”.


No memory or learning.


Example: A thermostat or spam filter.


Model-Based Reflex Agents


Maintain a model of the world to handle partially observable environments.


Example: Robotic vacuum (Roomba).


Goal-Based Agents


Use goals to decide actions, may explore multiple paths.


Require search and planning algorithms.


Example: Pathfinding robot.


Utility-Based Agents


Use utility functions to maximize performance and choose optimal actions.


Example: Financial trading bots that optimize profit vs. risk.


Learning Agents


Continuously improve by learning from past experiences.


Use Reinforcement Learning or Machine Learning.


Example: AlphaGo, self-driving cars.



3.2 Based on Functionality
Reactive Agents


React to environment changes immediately.


Example: Automatic emergency braking in cars.


Deliberative Agents


Build an internal model, plan actions carefully.


Example: Chess-playing AI.


Hybrid Agents


Combine reactive and deliberative strategies.


Example: Advanced robotics (Boston Dynamics robots).



3.3 Based on Role in a System
Autonomous Agents: Operate with minimal human input.


Collaborative Agents: Work with humans or other agents.


Interface Agents: Assist users by performing tasks on their behalf (e.g., Siri, Alexa).


Mobile Agents: Move across networks to perform tasks (used in distributed computing).



4. AI Agent Architectures
An architecture defines how the components of an agent are organized and how they interact.
4.1 Reactive Architecture
Focuses on direct mapping of perceptions to actions.


Pros: Fast response.


Cons: Limited intelligence.


Example: Obstacle-avoiding robot.


4.2 Deliberative (Symbolic) Architecture
Maintains internal models and plans before acting.


Pros: High reasoning capability.


Cons: Slower response.


Example: Automated planners, classical AI.


4.3 Hybrid Architecture
Combines reactive and deliberative for flexibility.


Example: Self-driving cars (instant obstacle avoidance + long-term route planning).


4.4 Learning Agent Architecture
Has a learning element that improves decision-making with time.


Loop: Perceive → Act → Learn → Improve policy.
